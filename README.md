## 1: Road Crack Detection
The road damage condition is primarily based on visual observations by people and some detection machines. For the first one, which is that check the condition by people, it needs experienced road managers and it is very expensive. In addition, by using visual observation, we cannot have a con- sistent inspection since some areas in the region may be ignored. In another way, many measurement system appears based on the large-scale inspection are widely conducted. However, it is considerably expensive to conduct such comprehensive inspections especially for small municipalities that lack the required financial resources.

Therefore, based on the issues mentioned above, some methods have been made to develop a method for analyzing road properties by using a combination of image processing technology and traditional camera record- ings. For example, a previous study proposed an pavement crack detection method using image processing techniques and a naive Bayes-based machine- learning approach [2]. In recent years, using deep neural network becomes a possible way to analyze the damage to road surfaces [16]. But those road damage detection methods focus only on the determination of the existence of damage. It is very necessary to know the position of cracks and the types of cracks. These kind of information can help us to better understand the conditions of cracks in a road and this makes it flexible to combine the framework with other useful applications.

In general, crack detection is a sub-domain of object detection in the field of computer vision. For object detection, the mainstream is using image classifier into an object detection task. These methods can describe the size and position of the object in the images and then use classifier to identify each type of object. There are many famous frameworks and network structures here.

The Faster R-CNN [11] has two stages for detection. In the first stage, images are processed using a feature extractor called the Region Proposal Network (RPN) and simultaneously, some intermediate level layers are used to predict class bounding box proposals. In the second stage, box proposals are used to crop features from the same intermediate feature map, which are subsequently input to the remainder of the feature extractor in order to predict a class label and its bounding box refinement for each proposal. It is important to note that Faster R-CNN does not crop proposals directly from the image and re-runs crops through the feature extractor, which would lead to duplicated computations.

YOLO is an object detection framework that can achieve high mean average precision (mAP) and speed [10]. In addition, YOLO can predict the region and class of objects with a single CNN. An advantageous feature of YOLO is that its processing speed is considerably fast because it solves the problem as a mere regression, detecting objects by considering background information. The YOLO algorithm outputs the coordinates of the bounding box of the object candidate and the confidence of the inference after receiving an image as input.

SSD [7] is an object detection framework that uses a single feed-forward convolutional network to directly predict classes and anchor offsets without requiring a second stage per-proposal classification operation. The key fea- ture of this framework is the use of multi-scale convolutional bounding box outputs attached to multiple feature maps at the top of the network

Darknet-19 [9] is a base model of the YOLO framework. The model has 19 convolutional layers and 5 maxpooling layers.

Inception V2 [5] and Inception V3 [14] enable one to increase the depth and breadth of the network without increasing the number of parameters or the computational complexity by introducing so-called inception units.

MobileNet [3] has been shown to achieve an accuracy comparable to VGG-16 on ImageNet with only 1/30th of the computational cost and model size. MobileNet is designed for efficient inference in various mobile vision applications. Its building blocks are depthwise separable convolutions that factorize a standard convolution into a depthwise convolution and a 1 Ã– 1 convolution, effectively reducing both the computational cost and number of parameters.

## 2: Crack Shapes Detection (see part2)
There are many traditional crack shapes detection methods based on tradi- tional image processing techniques such as using image thresholding, edge detection methods, and wavelet transform.

Image thresholding is a kind of preprocessing algorithm which is first used to reduce the illumination artifacts. Then thresholding is applied to the image to yield crack candidates. The processed crack image is further refined using morphological technologies. [4] is one of representatives of this group, which leverage graph-based methods for crack candidates refinement.

Edge detection-based methods: Yan et al [8] introduce morphological filters into crack detection and removes noise with a modified median fil- ter. Ayenu-Prah et al [1] apply Sobel edge detector to detect crack after smoothing image and removing speckle noise by a bidimensional empirical mode decomposition algorithm. Shi et al [12] apply random structure forest to exploit structural information for crack detection

Wavelet transform: In [17], a wavelet transform is applied to a pave- ment image, such that the image is decomposed into different frequency sub-bands. The distresses and noise are transformed into high and low am- plitude wavelet coefficients, respectively. Subirats et al [13] build a complex coefficient map by performing a 2D wavelet transform in a multi-scale way; then crack region can be obtained by searching the maximum wavelet co- efficients from largest to smallest scale. However, these approaches cannot deal with cracks with low continuity or high curvature property since the anisotropic characteristic of wavelet.

Recent years, deep learning achieves unprecedented success in computer vision [6]. A lot of works try to apply deep learning to crack detection task. Zhang et al [16] first propose a relatively shallow neural network, consist- ing of four convolutional layers and two fully connected layers, to perform crack detection in a patch-based way. Moreover, Zhang et al [16] compare their method with hand crafted feature based methods to demonstrate the advantages of feature representation of deep learning.
